CSS Selectors
-used to "find" (select) the HTML elements you want to style

We can divide CSS selectors into 5 categories:
-simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
-combinator selectors (select elements based on specific relationship between them)
-pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on certain state)
-pseudo-elements selectors (select and style part of element)
-attribute selectors (select elements based on attribute or attribute value)


CSS element selector 
-selects HTML elements based on element name
ex.
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
-all <p> elements on page be center-aligned with red text color


CSS id selector
-uses id attribute of HTML element to select specific element
-id of element is unique within page, id selector used to select one unique element
-to select element with specific id, write hash (#) character, followed by id of element
ex.
#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
** id name cannot start with number **


CSS class selector
-selects HTML elements with specific class attribute
-to select elements with specific class, write period (.) character, followed by class name
ex.
.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
-all HTML elements with class="center" becomes red and center-aligned
-can also specifiy specific HTML elements should be affectd by a class

ex.
p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
-only <p> elements with class="center" becomes red and center-aligned


HTML elements can also refer to more than one class
ex.
<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
** class name cannot start with number **


CSS universal selector
-universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on page
ex. 
* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
-affects every HTML element on page


CSS grouping selector
-selects all HTML elements with same style definitions
ex.
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: ceter;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
-h1, h2 and p elements have same style definitions
-better to group the selectors to minimize the code


-group selectors, separate each selector with a comma
ex.
h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
