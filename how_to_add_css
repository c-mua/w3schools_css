How to Add CSS
Three Ways to Insert CSS
1. External CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. Inline CSS


External CSS
-change look of website by changing one file
-each HTML page must include reference to external style sheet file inside <link> element,
inside head section
ex.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading.</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
-external style sheet can be written in any text editor and must be saved with .css extension
-external .css file should not contain any HTML tags


style.css
body{
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  margin-left: 20px;
}

** 
do not add space between property value and unit:
incorrect (space): margin- left: 20 px;
correct (nospace): margin-left: 20px; 
**



Internal CSS
-may be used if one single HTML page has unique style
-defined inside <style> element, inside head section
ex.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        background-color: linen;
      }

     h1 {
       color: maroon;
       margin-left: 40px;
     }
    </style>

  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1> This is a heading. </h1>
    <p> This is a paragraph. </p>
  </body>

</html>
-defined within <style> element, inside <head> section of HTML page




Inline CSS
-apply unique style for single element
-add style attribute to relevant element
-style attribute can contain any CSS property
ex.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=en>
  <head>
  <head>

  <body>
    <h1 style="color: blue; text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
    <p style="color: red;">This is a paragraph</p>
  </body>

</html>
** Inline style loses many advantages of style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly. **




Multiple Style Sheets
-If some properties have been defined for same selector (element) in different style sheets
-value from the last read style sheet be used

ex.
Assume external style sheet has following style for <h1> element:
h1 {
  color: navy;
}

Assume an internal style sheet also has the following style for <h1> element:
h1 {
  color: orange;
}

if internal style defined AFTER link to external style sheet, <h1> elements becomes "orange"
ex.
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: orange;
    }
  </style>
</head>


if internal style defined BEFORE link to external style sheet, <h1> elements becomes "navy"
ex.
<head>
  <style>
  h1 {
    color: orange;
  }
  </style>
  
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>




Cascading Order
-What styles used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

-All the styles in page "cascade" into new "virtual" style sheet by following rules, where number one has highest priority:
1. Inline style (inside HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in head section)
3. Browser default
**inline style has highest priority, and overrides external and internal styles and browser defaults**
